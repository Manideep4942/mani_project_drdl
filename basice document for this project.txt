Step 1: Install the distutils package

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Run the following command to install distutils:


pip install setuptools this package is used for the voice taking input but in the code 
we dont use this a like import setuptools insted of this we use:
import distutils



STEP1: NEED TO INSTALL THE PACKAGES TO RUN THE CODE :
import tkinter 
from tkinter import messagebox
import speech_recognition # THIS PACKAGE IS USED FOR THE SPEECH RECOGINAZATION IN PROGRAMM
import pyttsx3 THIS IS FOR VOICE OF SPEECH
import mysql.connector #THIS IS FOR DATABASE CONNECTIVITY
import distutils # TO INSTALL THIS PACKAGE WE NEED WRITE LIKE THIS PIP INSTAL setuptools



to work the voice to voice offline you need to install the package vosk
ex:pip install vosk

to download this package you need to download from the apachi 
Please download the model from https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models and unpack as 'model' in the current folder.
i have mentioned this link programm if not availale it show the reference to download 
after download you need to place this module where your progamm file is there


here the more clear information for you :
To modify the code to work with voice-to-voice interaction without relying on the internet, you can use the offline speech recognition library, Vosk. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

Install the necessary libraries: Vosk, pyaudio, and pyttsx3.
sh
Copy code
pip install vosk pyaudio pyttsx3 mysql-connector-python
Download a Vosk model for offline speech recognition from Vosk Models. For example, the small model for English is sufficient for many tasks: vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15.

Extract the downloaded model to a directory of your choice.

Modify the provided Python script to use Vosk for offline speech recognition.

Here is the updated script with these changes:
